## Description

PLOC is a simple PL/SQL code to doc converter which supports comments written in
Markdown and generates Markdown files ready to use for your documentation. It is
a npm package and therefore written in JavaScript. Simple means here really
simple - the converter is only about 120 lines of commented code. Here a short
demo package spec which demonstrates the idea behind PLOC:

~~~sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE demo AUTHID current_user IS
c_demo_name CONSTANT VARCHAR2(30 CHAR) := 'A demo package for PLOC';
/**
Your Leading Level One Header
=============================

You can use standard markdown here to describe your package, functions and procedures.

- This is a list entry
- A second one

**/


FUNCTION demo_function (
  p_num_param IN NUMBER,   -- Some short parameter description.
  p_vc2_param IN VARCHAR2) -- Another parameter description.
RETURN BLOB;
/**
Description of the function.

EXAMPLE

```sql
DECLARE
  l_result VARCHAR2(100);
BEGIN
  l_result := demo_function(
    p_num_param => 100,
    p_vc2_param => 'some text'));
  -- do something with the result...
END;
{{/}}
```
**/


PROCEDURE demo_procedure; /** Only a small description. **/

END demo;
~~~

- The converter picks up everything between the keywords PACKAGE, FUNCTION,
  PROCEDURE, TYPE or TRIGGER and a following PL/SQL multiline comment starting
  with `/**` and ending with `**/` (the double stars are used to support normal
  multiline comments)
- Anything else is ignored - if you want to include something in your docs, you
  have to provide a comment in the mentioned style after the relevant signature
- In the comments you can provide standard Markdown - anything what the target
  system (GitHub for example) can convert to valid HTML (we do not generate the
  HTML here, only the Markdown file)
- In the example above the constant `c_demo_name` is included in the docs - if
  you don't want this move the code behind the comment - you decide which
  globals are documented and which not
- There is no parameter parsing: the converter prints for each item the
  following informations
  - A header (`# Package demo` or `## FUNCTION demo_function` in our example)
  - The comment content
  - A paragraph containing the word `SIGNATURE`
  - The signature of the PACKAGE, FUNCTION, PROCEDURE, TYPE or TRIGGER wrapped
    in a code block
  - Depending on the number of items (configurable) a TOC is generated in front
    of the document
  - A "Do not edit directly..." HTML comment with the source file path info is
    also generated on top of the file
- A leading level one header in the first comment (usually the package
  description) is used as the overall document header

Many words... Here the converted output of our example package:

~~~md
<!-- DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY - it is generated from source file tests/demo.pks -->
<!-- markdownlint-disable MD003 MD012 MD024 MD033 -->

Your Leading Level One Header

## FAQ

QUESTION: Why no JavaDoc compatible parameter desriptions?

ANSWER: In my opinion this does NOT follow the DRY principle and is error prone.
PL/SQL is a strong typed language. Anything you need to know is visible in the
signature. There is no need to repeat the parameters in a formal way only to
comment a little bit. For short comments you can put single line comments direct
after the parameters (see  function `demo_function` in the example above). If
you need to write more refer to the Markdown main comment. On long parameter
lists you will more easily follow the single line comments direct after the
parameters then looking around between the signature and the formal JavaDoc
comments.

QUESTION: Why do I need to put the comments below the signature?

ANSWER: If we put the comments before the signature the PL/SQL compiler will
strip out the comment - at least for the comment of the package itself or a
standalone function, procedure or trigger. If you then get the DDL of your
objects out of the database with dbms_metadata you will lose these first
comments. This will be no problem if you follow the files first approach
together with a version control system but who knows in what ways your code will
be inspected? It would be nice for the reviewers to get all provided comments.


## Installation

In your repo install ploc:

```js
npm install ploc
```


## Example for a single file

Add a new npm script entry in your package.json - here an example from my PLEX
project - we call it `build:docs`:

```js
{
  "name": "plex",
  "scripts": {
    "build:docs": "npx ploc --in PLEX.pks --out README.md",
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "ploc": "^0.6.1"
  }
}
```

Notes:

- [npx](https://blog.npmjs.org/post/162869356040/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner)
  is a npm command to run locally installed packages with a command line
  interface and is available since npm 5.2.0
- ploc provides a cli
- We use only two of our possible three parameters: for the help run `npx ploc
  --help` or `npx ploc -h`

```bash
> npx ploc --help

Usage: ploc [options]

-i, --in:         The glob pattern for the code files to read.
                  (default is "**/*.pks")

-o, --out:        The pattern for the doc files to write.
                  (default is "{folder}{file}.md")
                  {folder} = in file path with trailing directory separator
                  {file} = in file name without extension

-t, --toc:        How many items (methods including object/package name) the
                  code must have before a TOC is included.
                  (default is 3)

--tocStyles:      Inline styles to use for the TOC. If provided, the TOC
                  is generated as a HTML unordered list instead of a
                  Markdown list to be able to use the styles.

--autoHeaderIds:  Boolean - if present the headers are generated in HTML
                  format instead of Markdown to be able to integrate the IDs.

-h, --help:       Command line help.

-d, --debug:      Write CLI arguments to console.

Example 1: npx ploc --in "**/*.pks" --out {folder}{file}.md
Example 2: npx ploc --out docs/{file}.md
Example 3: npx ploc -i "**/*.*(pks|sql)" -o docs/{file}.md -t 5
Example 4: npx ploc --in "src/*.pks" --out docs/{file}.md --autoHeaderIds --tocStyles "float: right;"
https://blog.npmjs.org/post/162869356040/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner
```

Running the script:

```sh
npm run build:docs
```

The output will be something like this:

```sh
> plex@ build:docs /Users/ottmar/code/plex
> npx ploc --in PLEX.pks --out README.md

PLEX.pks => README.md
```

For each generated Markdown document you get one log entry with the input and
output file - here we have only one entry: `PLEX.pks => README.md`


## Example for multiple files

We add now a script called `build:all_docs` to our package.json:

```js
{
  "name": "plex",
  "scripts": {
    "build:docs": "npx ploc --in PLEX.pks --out README.md",
    "build:all_docs": "npx ploc",
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "ploc": "^0.6.1"
  }
}
```

As you can see we omit simply all parameters and therefore the defaults are used
(in = `**/*.pks`, out = `{folder}{file}.md`), which results in converting all
found `*.pks` files in all directories and subdirectories. Here the output of
this conversion:

```sh
> plex@ build:all_docs /Users/ottmar/code/plex
> npx ploc

PLEX.pks => PLEX.md
src/test_1.pks => src/test_1.md
src/test_2.pks => src/test_2.md
```

Obviously I have some test files in the `src` folder. You can also see on this
example that you can use the variables `{folder}` (directory path of source file
with trailing directory separator) and `{file}` (source file name without
extension) in your `out` parameter. The `in` parameter is a standard [glob file
pattern](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob#glob).

GLOB COMMENTS: If you use wildcards in your `in` parameter and you have the
feeling it does not work, then try to wrap the parameter in single or double
quotes. Depending on your operating system the shell already expands the
wildcard characters and ploc gets only the first match - you can debug the
arguments by providing `-d` or `--debug` to the call like so: `npx ploc -d -i
'tests/*.*(pks|sql)'` (process all \*.pks and \*.sql files in dir tests). For
Windows users: Please use only the forward slash as a directory separator in
your glob patterns!

One common use case is to place all docs in a docs folder - we change therefore
our `build:all_docs` script:

```js
{
  "name": "plex",
  "scripts": {
    "build:docs": "npx ploc --in PLEX.pks --out README.md",
    "build:all_docs": "npx ploc --out docs/{file}.md",
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "ploc": "^0.6.1"
  }
}
```

The resulting output should something like this:

```sh
> plex@ build:all_docs /Users/ottmar/code/plex
> npx ploc --out docs/{file}.md

PLEX.pks => docs/PLEX.md
src/test_1.pks => docs/test_1.md
src/test_2.pks => docs/test_2.md
```


## Automation with a file watcher

We use here [chokidar](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chokidar-cli) - you can
install it with `npm install chokidar-cli`. Then we create a watch script
entry - here it is named `watch:docs`.

```js
{
  "name": "plex",
  "scripts": {
    "build:docs": "npx ploc --in PLEX.pks --out README.md",
    "watch:docs": "chokidar PLEX.pks package.json --initial -c \"npm run build:docs\""
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "chokidar-cli": "^1.2.1",
    "ploc": "^0.6.1"
  }
}
```

Notes:

- `chokidar PLEX.pks package.json` the files to watch (or glob patterns) are
  listed with a whitspace character as a separator
- `--initial` tells the watcher to run the script on start
- `-c \"npm run build:docs\""` is the command to run when one of the watched
  files changes - the escaped double quotes are important for windows

To start the watcher you run this:

```sh
npm run watch:docs
```

Here the output after the start:

```sh
> plex@ watch:docs /Users/ottmar/code/plex
> chokidar PLEX.pks package.json --initial -c "npm run build:docs"

add:PLEX.pks
add:package.json
Watching "PLEX.pks", "package.json" ..

> plex@ build:docs /Users/ottmar/code/plex
> npx ploc --in PLEX.pks --out README.md

PLEX.pks => README.md
```

The terminal is blocked because of the running watcher - after a file change you
will see something like this:

```sh
change:PLEX.pks

> plex@ build:docs /Users/ottmar/code/plex
> npx ploc --in PLEX.pks --out README.md

PLEX.pks => README.md
```

## SQL\*Plus Special Characters

`/`, `#` and `@` are special SQL\*Plus characters. If they occur as the first
character in a line then SQL\*Plus does some special functionality - independend
from the occurence inside a comment or a string literal. So be warned - the
minimum problem you will get is that compiling PL/SQL code in an SQL\*Plus script
will fail. The maximum problem under some circumstances is the [lost of data][example].

To avoid these problems we have to escape the characters like so: `{{/}} {{#}} {{@}}`.
PLOC does unescape these characters when generating your markdown docs.

[example]: http://www.oraclefindings.com/2016/08/16/sql-plus-hash-pound/


## Markdown Headers

The generated doc is already structured with level one and level two headers. If you want
to use Markdown headers in your comments then please use level three to level six headers.
Please beware of the potential SQL\*Plus issues described above. To avoid these you have
to escape the first hash character like so:

```md
{{#}}## Level 3 Header
{{#}}### Level 4 Header
{{#}}#### Level 5 Header
{{#}}##### Level 6 Header
```


## Changelog

### 0.9.0 - 2024-12-xx

- Fix parsing issue for complex objects (thanks to github.com/gpaulissen for providing feedback and a test object)
- Non existing folders for generated docs will be created automatically (thanks to github.com/erstert3st for the pull request)
- Update dependencies

### 0.8.0 - 2021-03-17

- New parameter: `--autoHeaderIds`
  - Boolean - if present the headers are generated in HTML format instead of
    Markdown to be able to integrate the IDs
  - Header IDs came in the past with the TOC implicitly (until the last release,
    where I dropped this) - now you have the choice with a parameter

### 0.7.0 - 2021-03-15

- New parameter: `--tocStyles` to provide inline styles to use for the TOC
  - If provided, the TOC is generated as a HTML unordered list instead of a
    Markdown list to be able to use the styles
  - Example `npx ploc --in "src/*.pks" --out docs/{file}.md --tocStyles "float: right;"`

### 0.6.3 - 2021-03-13

- Fixed: TOC links only working with generated HTML header IDs
- Fixed: TOC Links to overloaded functions and procedures are not working
- Use pure Markdown for the headers since many Markdown processors automatically
  generate header IDs - for example in VS Code it is working out of the box and
  GitHub does it also

### 0.6.2 - 2020-10-10

- Fixed: Add a markdownlint configuration on top of each generated file to get
  no warnings for rules MD003, MD012, MD033 (also see issue
  [#5](https://github.com/ogobrecht/ploc/issues/5))

### 0.6.1 - 2018-06-20

- Fixed: Escaped SQL\*Plus special characters are now replaced globally

### 0.6.0 - 2018-06-20

- Improved generated document structure
  - A leading level one header in the first comment (usually the package
    description) is used as the overall document header
  - An eventually rendered TOC is following this overall header
- PLOC does now unescape escaped special SQL\*Plus characters (see section
  "SQL\*Plus Special Characters")
- Changed minimum number of items to render a TOC from 4 to 3

### 0.5.0 - 2018-12-23

- Add "Do not edit..." message to generated files
- Add `debug` param to CLI for parsed arguments
- Improved README regarding glob patterns
- Internal renamings

### 0.4.1 - 2018-12-18

- Fixed: parsing regex breaks when keywords `package`, `function`, `procedure`,
  `trigger` or `type` found in a signature (not the starting one, sure, but in a
  line comment or type declaration)
  - Example with two problems: `demo_param my_table.my_column%TYPE --A cool function param`
- New (manual) test script

### 0.4.0 - 2018-12-15

- Add CLI
- Add TOC to README
- Changelog back into the README (feels more natural since we have now a TOC
  here)

### 0.3.2 - 2018-11-25

Docs only: Corrections to the readme and an additional changelog file.

### 0.3.1 - 2018-11-21
